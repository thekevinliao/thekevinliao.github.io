//         <p>My name is Kevin Liao, and I am an avid programmer and have a passion for technology. I have been coding for years, but I recently started working on projects at the beginning of high school when I joined Stuyvesant High School'school
//             FRC robotics team, Stuypulse team 694. My interest in technology stemmed from my first touch of a computer when I was 5, and continued using it ever since. The person who introduced me to code was my brother. He 
//             explained to me what technology was really about, and what was happening behind the screen of the devices we use everyday. Since that day, I have been devoted to figuring out how things work.</p>
