        <p>My name is Kevin Liao, and I am an avid programmer and have a passion for technology. I have been coding for years, but I recently started working on projects at the beginning of high school when I joined Stuyvesant High School'school
            FRC robotics team, Stuypulse team 694. My interest in technology stemmed from my first touch of a computer when I was 5, and continued using it ever since. The person who introduced me to code was my brother. He 
            explained to me what technology was really about, and what was happening behind the screen of the devices we use everyday. Since that day, I have been devoted to figuring out how things work.</p>
